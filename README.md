# Paul-Schweigl-Practical-Machine-Learning-Prediction-Assignment

Hello, I am Paul and you will find my final project for the "Practical Machine Learning" class of John Hopkins University in this repository.

Please download the ZIP folder pressing the green "clone or download ZIP" button. Once you did that you can acess my html and r markdown (and not only see their code). My apologies for the inconvenience.
